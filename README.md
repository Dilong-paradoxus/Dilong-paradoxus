Hello!

- Dilong paradoxus is a carnivorous dinosaur and early ancestor of Tyrannosaurus. I'm not a dinosaur but I like drawing them!
- I'm working on a lot of personal projects, including a MEMS-based seismometer! 
- I have a Bachelor's in Geology and a GIS certificate, plus experience working with plants, urban planning, and environmental restoration.
